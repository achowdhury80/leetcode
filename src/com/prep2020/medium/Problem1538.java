		// The main idea is that if we knew two elements to be the same, then
		// including their indices in the query() call lets us figure out the
		// other two. For example, if we knew elements at indices X and Y to be
		// the same, then invoking query(X, Y, A, B) would mean that
		//
		// - if we got 0, then the elements at both A and B are different from
		//   the elements at X and Y;
		// - if we got 2, then one of the elements at A and B is the same as
		//   the elements at X and Y, but the other one is different;
		// - if we got 4, then the elements at both A and B are the same as
		//   the elements at X and Y.
		//
		// So, our objective is to locate among the first four indices the two whose
		// elements are the same (which is guaranteed to exist). Since the query()
		// function can only return three potential results, by the pigeonhole
		// principle invoking it four times will produce at least two identical 
		// results. And if we select the arguments to query() such that in two
		// invocations three out four arguments are the same, then the different
